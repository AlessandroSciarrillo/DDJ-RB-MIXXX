Mixxx mapping for Pioneer DDJ-RB controller

I have a Pioneer DDJ-RB controller and I wanted to use it with Mixxx(https://mixxx.org), however as this controller is newish no one has written the mapping for it. I first tried the mapping for Pionner DDJ-SB2 and I could get the Mixer and basic Decks working but a lot of the feature were not mapped, so I found the Pioneer documentation for Midi mapping and started work on this project.

At the moment this is a !!Work In Progress!! while I map all the midi messages. I have not tested the inital version yet.
